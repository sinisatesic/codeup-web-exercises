// Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

// Course intended to infrom/introduce queues, stacks, linked lists, graphs, trees,
// breadth-first, depth-first, tree traversal algorithms, and a variety of sorting algorithms.

// goal of content is to thinking differently/specifically about data structures - also to break
// down problems concerning data modification and access with JavaScript; a focus on their automic
// and algorithmic steps. 

// Content is intended to influence thinking divergently (drawing apart from a common point).

// Hopefully to understand multiple manners of getting a solution to the same problem, and the 
// difference in tradeoffs between them.
