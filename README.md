Greetings!

This is intended as a brief description about this repo; it hosts HTML, CSS and JavaScript exercises/practice files created
during my time at Codeup (full-stack web development).

The lessons cover a vast range of topics such HTML elements, CSS grid, flexbox, Bootstrap, es5, es6, jQuery, DOM manipulation, BOM manipulation,
promises, JS functions, arrays, objects, JSON manipulation, and plenty more.

The collective range of exercise content ends before we moved into Java 1, Java 2, MySQL and Java 3.

If you have any questions or wish to collaborate on any projects together, please let me know: sinisa.tesic210@gmail.com
